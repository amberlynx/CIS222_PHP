// 1. (5pts) Create a function or class that can accept at least one string parameter.
//             Assume the parameter is a password, hash and return it.

    function acceptPassword($pass) { return SHA1($pass); }
    

// 2. (3pts) Let's say you have a password saved in the $pass variable.
//              But do not assume this is true!
//              Execute some checks to ensure the variable is not null and is indeed a string.
$pass = '';

    if(isset($pass) && is_string($pass)) { echo 'Password is not null and is a string!'; }


// 3. (2pts) Use the function you created above to hash the $pass variable.
//              Then save the hashed password in an $encp variable.

    $encp = acceptPassword($pass);


// B. (2pt) Describe a honey pot.

  //  A honey pot is a way of verifying that it is in fact a user and not a bot using your site.
  //  An example of a honey pot is creating a blank field on a form that users would know not to
  //  fill out, trapping the bot when it fills it out.
