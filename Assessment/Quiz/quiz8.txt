// 1. (4pts) Using a PHP function, save a cookie named season.
//              The cookie should contain the value saved in the $cv variable.
//              The cookie should expire after 90 days.
$cv = "CryptoWinter";

    function saveCookie($cv) { setcookie("Season", $cv, time()+(86400 * 90)); }


// 2. (3pt) Imagine you have a user_id in a variable called $uid.
//          Write all the code needed below to store their user_id in a session variable.
//          Name this session index current_user_id.
$uid = 42;

    session_start();
    if(isset( $_POST[$uid])) { $_SESSION[current_user_id] =  $_POST[$uid]; }
    
    if(isset($_SESSION[current_user_id])) { $uid = $_SESSION[current_user_id]; }
    else { $_SESSION[current_user_id] = 0; }


// 3. (3pts) Now write the following echo statements,
//                          where X and Y are the users season cookie and user_id.
//              Your current season is X.
//              Your user ID is Y.

    saveCookie('X');
    echo 'Your current season is ' + $_COOKIE['Season'];
    
    $_SESSION['current_user_id'] = 'Y';
    echo 'Your user ID is ' + $_SESSION['current_user_id'];


// B. (1pt) Explain how you might use the HTTP_USER_AGENT data in the $_SERVER array...
//                                                ...to improve the security of your site.

    The HTTP_USER_AGENT identifies different user features and can be used for security purposes by identifying things
    like what kind of browser the user is using to reduce the possibilty of a hacker pretending to be the user. In the $_SERVER
    array it will return as a haystack and if there is a needle in the haystack then it will return false and not execute, 
    protecting the user's account or the system from malicious threats.
